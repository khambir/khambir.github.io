Each of us uses various software daily to perform our work efficiently and effectively. I have prepared my top programs that I use every day, and I would be glad if you find something new and useful for yourself. Enjoy 😉

## [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com)
Undoubtedly, the first place in my top list is honored by Alfred. In short, Alfred is an application launcher. The paid version of this product offers new possibilities in the form of Workflows. 
A Workflow allows you to automate repetitive tasks and significantly increase productivity.
Here's an example Workflow for quickly launching an Xcode project:

How to use it? Launch Alfred using a hotkey (it resembles Spotlight) and enter the keyword for launching the Workflow - xc followed by the name of the project you want to open. A single press of Enter, and your project is already launched 💥

## [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash)
A professional and experienced developer often looks for answers to their questions in the official documentation for various products. Would you like to have all the necessary documentation in one place? Then you're definitely looking for Dash 😉

Dash is an API documentation browser. Dash provides access to documentation for over 200 APIs.
As a bonus, Dash integrates with Alfred ❤️

## [Proxyman](https://proxyman.io/)
Proxyman is a native high-performance macOS application that allows developers to easily capture, inspect, and manipulate HTTP requests/responses. It is similar to Charles Proxy, but with a much more modern interface.

Proxyman enables you to intercept requests, write scripts to process and substitute server responses. It has a built-in simple guide for setting up proxies for iOS/Android simulators and physical devices.
The program is regularly updated and enriched with numerous new features 💪

## [Rapid API](https://paw.cloud)
Rapid API is an HTTP client that I use for testing and documenting APIs. This client has a convenient, native interface that allows you to build requests, verify server responses, and export APIs.

It is an excellent alternative to Postman. Rapid API is much more convenient and significantly faster than its main competitor, and it supports code generation (which can be a major advantage for some).
> Rapid API comes at a cost, but every Black Friday, the folks at Rapid API give away their product for free without any limitations through their Twitter account. 

## [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com)
Drafts is a quick note-taking app, a super convenient editor, and cloud synchronization. The simplicity of this product is unparalleled, and that's what attracted me to it. Whenever I need to jot something down, I open Drafts first.
P.S. The free version of the app is more than sufficient.

# What's next? 🛣
I have shared about the tools that can increase the efficiency of your work and solve work-related tasks. I would be glad if you share your list of favorite programs with me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khambir/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/VKhambir).
I would be happy to try them out and write the second part of this article with new tools 😉
