This is the blog of a person who views the world through the glasses of a developer 🤓

These glasses often display code, documentation, text from technical books, and of course, challenges from the world of IT. In this blog, you will read everything that the developer sees through the glasses ✍️

By the way, my name is Vlad and these are my glasses. Now I am a Principal SE in a Big Tech company, continuing to explore new horizons 🚀
