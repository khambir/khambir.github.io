This is the blog of a person who views the world through the glasses of a developer 🤓

These glasses often display code, documentation, text from technical books, and of course, challenges from the world of IT. In this blog, you will read everything that the developer sees through the glasses ✍️

By the way, my name is Vlad and these are my glasses. I have experience working for the government, a quick rise and fall in a startup, and varied experience in an outsourcing company, where I had the opportunity to work on a huge amount of interesting projects.

And what about now? Well, now I am a Team Lead of the iOS team in a large product company, continuing to explore new horizons 🚀
